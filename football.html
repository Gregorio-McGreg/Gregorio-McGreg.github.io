<h1>How to Play Silent Football</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Silent Football, or SF, is a wonderfull game. The object of the game is to avoid being punished. If you forget one of the rules, or screw up, you will be punished. You can also punish others if you catch them screwing up to. This is a complete guide to playing SF, meaning every rule you will ever need to know is on this page. There are many variations of SF, and the one you'll learn here is the best, the <u>real</u> silent football. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>A Note on Commisioners</h3>
<p>Silent Football is not a democracy. The commisioner is the law, so respect them. You can remove them (I'll get to that later), and they can resign. <u>Pay attention to your commisioner and do as they say!</u></p>

<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Silent Football is a gentelmenly game. All open-handed gestures, speaking out of turn, and ungentelmenlike comments will be punished. If you wish to speak, raise a fist and wait for the commisioner to call on you. Saying something irrelevant or unhelpful is grounds for punishment. When refering to people, they are referenced with a prefix (Mr., Ms., Mrs., ect.), and their last name (ex. Mr. Bilzor, or Mr. Billig.). The one exception to this is the commisioner. The commisioner is refered to as Mr. commisioner, not by their last name.</p>
 
<h3>Moves</h3>
<p>At its core, Silent Football is a passing game. The ball's poition may be refered to as "The ball is in _______'s court." The commisioner starts the ball, and may move it around the circle as they wish. Once they start, whoever has the ball in their court may move it to whoever they wish using the moves described below.</p>

<h5>Move 1: The Single Thwack</h5>
<p>To use a Thwack, audibly tap your left or right thigh with the corrseponding hand (left for left and right for right, cross-thwacking is grounds for punishment). If you choose to Thwack to the left, the person immediatly to your left gets the ball, same with your right.</p>

<h5>Move 2: The Double Thwack</h5>
<p>A Double Thwack is simmilar in principal to the Single Thwack. However, instead of hitting your thigh once, hit it twice. This will move the ball two courts to your left or right, instead of one. In all other ways, a Double Thwack is the same as a Single Thwack. When we get to moving off (I'll explain later), Double Thwacks count as Single Thwacks. Please note: a Triple Thwack does not exist and attempting one is a punishable offense. Same with Quadruple Thwacks, ect.</p>

<h5>Move 3: The Zoom</h5>
<p>Zooms are complicated to understand, but easy once you understand them. Propper Zoom form is as follows: clench both your hands into fists, then hold them together at the knuckles. (touching each other, but not interlocking. Think of it like fistbumping yourself.) Once you've connected your fists, place your fists next to your left ear such that by looking foreward just above your elbow, you can "aim" at people by turning your head-arms arrangement. Ask your commisioner for a demonstration if you're feeling confused. A Zoom works as follows: aim at whoever you wish to send the ball to. The ball is now in their court. </p>
<p>A note on Zooms: you cannot zoom to someone immediatly to your left or right. You must Leery thwack, Single Thwack or Shmodus (or Shrug) to them. If there is confusion as to who you Zoomed to, point a fist at whoever you intended to Zoom to. You may have to step forward to the middle of the circle (to make your target more obvious) if there is still confusion.</p>

<h5>Move 6: The Shrug</h5>
<p>Just as the name suggests, a Shrug is a a Shrug. It should be close-handed, but open hands are acceptable under some commisioners. A Shrug sends the ball back to whoever gave it to you. A commisioner cannot shrug on the first move. However, anyone can shrug when the game is resumed, for example after a punishment, comment, quesion, ect. If you Shrug after someone Shrugs to you, the ball goes back to them not whoever sent the ball to you originaly.</p>

<h5>A Quick Rule, moving off:</h5>
<p>This is perhaps the most interesting rule in Silent Football: it makes the game interesting. A move cannot be played three times in a row, privatly or publicly. For example, you cannot Thwack three times in a row, even if other people do something else in-between you doing it. That would be a Thwack off. The whole group cannot thwack three times in a row, either. If three people Thwack consecutively, the third person to commit the Thwack has Thwacked off, meaning they will receive punishment.<p>

<h5>Move 5: The Shmodus (sh-moh-dus)</h5>
<p>A Shmodus is the same as a Shrug. However, Shrugs are not more powerful than Shmoduses, meaning you can Shmodus a Shrug but you cannot Shrug a Shmodus.</p>

<h5>Move 6: The Leeary Thwack (sometimes called a zoom thwack)</h5>
<p>A Leeary Thwack is the most complicated move. It works as a zoom, but counts as a thwack and a zoom. Propper form is as follows: audibly thwack your thigh to the following beat: eigth-note, sixteenth-note, sixteenth-note. Then, with an open and upwards-facing palm, point towards whoever you'd like to have the ball in their court. Here's the catch: ya know how how when you do something three times in a row, it's bad? Well, if you Thwack, Thwack again, then Leeary Thwack, you have Thwacked off because a Leeary Thwack can act as a Thwack or a Zoom. Same thing if you Zoom twice, then Leeary Thwack, it's a Zoom off. Another interesting thing, consider the following sequence: Thwack, Zoom, Leeary Thwack. This is actualy a Move Off!</p>

<h3>Punishments</h3>
<p>If you notice that someone has broken any of the rules stated here, raise a fist to pause the game. When (and if) the commisioner calls on you, explain the rule you think they broke. You may have to ask for permision to demonstrate if their form is bad. If the commisioner agrees, now we must decide their punishment(s). If you have a suggested punishment, raise your fist. If the commisioner agrees, said commisioner will select someone to administer the punishment, and the punishment will be adminestered.</p>

<h3>Coup d'état</h3>
<p>If you aren't satisfied with the job your commisioner is doing, you can chant "Coup d'état!" However, be aware: if nobody joins you in the chant, you have committed the worst offence.</p>

<h3>Selecting a New / First Commisioner</h3>
<p>When a vote for commisioner is neccisary, whoever suggested the game will call "fist for commisioner" when ready. Then everyone will point a fist at whoever they'd like to cast their vote for. The "caller" will tally the votes. If the players are being taught Silent Football, the most experienced player will be Commisioner by default and all coup d'états will be nullified.</p>

<p>Some things for a commisioner to keep in mind about atmosphere: At the beging of the game it si extreemly customary for the commisioner to say "Tip of the caps (everyone tips their imaginary caps). Let the games begin. The Ball is in my court."</p>
