        <h1>How to Eat a Bannana and Make it into Infinite Food</h1>

        <h2>Part 1: the Peeling</h2>
        <p>First, place your hand on the long, yellow thing and rip it appart. You should now be able to remove the smooth exterior of the Bannana. Once this has been done, you are ready to place the Bannana in your mouth.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: the Placing</h2>
        <p>Once the long yellow thing has been removed of its exterior, you are ready to place it in your mouth. With a firm grip, clench your hand around the Bannana. After the Bannana is secure, move it up to your mouth. Open your mouth enough to let the Bannana inside. Then, close your lips around the Bannana. You are now ready to chew the Bannana.</p>

        <h2>Part 3: the Chewing</h2>
        <p>Once the long yellow thing has had its protection removed and you've put it in your mouth, you're ready to chew it. Bite down on it, to remove a piece of it from your hand. Next, use your teeth to move it around a little. Continue doing this untill the stuff in your mouth has reached a smooth, creamy texture. You are now ready to swallow.</p>

        <h2>Part 4: the Swallowing</h2>
        <p>Now that the Bannana has been chewed, you need to swallow it. To do this, first lift your throat up to allow the substance to dribble down into your stomach. You are now ready to digest the substance.</p>

        <h2>Part 5: the Digesting</h2>
        <p>Now that the Bannana has been swallowed, you are ready to digest it. There isn't much to do now, just lie on the couch until your intesstines start feeling lumpy. You are now ready to expel the Bannana out as feces.</p>

        <h2>Part 6: the Expultion of a Bannana in the Form of Feces</h2>
        <p>Now that the Bannana has been digested, it's time to expel it as feces. First, sit on a toilet. Now contract your muscles until the Bannana is no longer inside of you. You are now ready to make it into soil.</p>

        <h2>Part 7: the Soil-Making</h2>
        <p>Now that your bannana has been expeled as feces, it's time to make it into soil so you can get infinate food from it. First, reach into the tiolet and capture the fecefied Bannana. Then dump it in a compost barrel for six to eight weeks. After removing it, you will be ready to make a plant a new bannana.</p>

        <h2>Part 8: the Planting</h2>
        <p>After the fecefied Bannana has been made into dirt, you need to pland a baby bannana in the soil. Grab a seed out of the feces, and stuff it into the soil.</p>

        <h2>Part 9: the Mantaining of a Baby Bannana</h2>
        <p>After planting a baby bannana, you must water it daily. You are now ready to harvest the Bannanas from the Bannana tree.</p>

        <h2>Part 10: the Harvesting</h2>
        <p>Now that your baby Bannana has been maintained, it should be a mature adult Bananna tree. To harvest new bannanas, grab a smooth yellow thing and rip it off from the rest of the tree. With this new bannana, repeat steps 1 - 9. Happy eating! (With a little practice this can be made into an infinate food source)</p>
