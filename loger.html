<h1>Ode to Loger Taper Fade</h1>
<p>Logan walks with a rhythm all his own,<br>

But you can call him Loger when the mood has grown.<br>

Smooth as a breeze on a cool spring parade,<br>

They whisper Loger-Taper-Fade, crisp as a fade.<br>
<br>

When the world gets loud, and the crowd starts to sway,<br>

He slips into the shadows, Lo-key all the way.<br>

A quiet force, like thunder in sleep,<br>

Carrying secrets the wild wind keep.<br>
<br>

But to those who know him, and call him a friend,<br>

It’s Logee, the name that softens the end.<br>

A laugh in the dark, a spark in the cold,<br>

A story of courage that's yet to be told.<br>
<br>

By many names, he dances through days,<br>

A chameleon soul in a sun-dappled haze.<br>

Logan, Loger, or Lo-Key in shade,<br>

You’ll always remember Loger-Taper-Fade.</p>
