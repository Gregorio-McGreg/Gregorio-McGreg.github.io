<h1>Colby's Crush Puzzle</h1>
<p>So, you're interested in finding out who Colby's crush is? Or... maybe you just want a little puzzle challenge? Well, you've come to the right place. Below is the first hint in an elaborate rabit hole of a puzzle, and at the end is Colby's crush! However, take note: this is not the only hint on Colby's website. There may be one, two, or 18,948,290.67 hints scattered around this website. This is just the begining! Oh, and don't worry. I made sure this was too difficult for ChatGPT to solve. And no, I did not make this with ChatGPT. This actualy took so much time.</p>

<h4>so, uh, well, here it is... no going back now, here's the first hint!</h4>
<p>According to my dad, I’m fourteen so my biggest factor should be my education. Instead, I’m playing Minecraft. He says I should “treasure myself” or something.</p>
<h4>Actualy, I'm not that concerned. This puzzle has 9 steps (I counted), and they're all very difficult.</h4>
